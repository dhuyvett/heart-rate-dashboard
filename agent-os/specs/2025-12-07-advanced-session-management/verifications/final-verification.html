## Executive Summary

All advanced session management tasks were implemented and verified. Session naming, rename flows, start gating, end-without-new-session navigation, and interrupted-session completion are in place with database, state, and UI updates. Targeted and full test suites now pass after updating legacy tests for the new naming API.
