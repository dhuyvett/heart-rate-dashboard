When starting a new session, begin with the session paused and show a screen that allows the user to name the session. The default name based on the time and date should be pre-filled. Once the session is named, there should be a way to start the session. There should be a way to rename historical and running sessions. There should be a way to end a session without starting another (returning to the device selection screen). If the app exits with a running session, when the app is restarted, that session should be seen as complete.
